<h1>Ready Set, Shuffle! (how many shuffles does it take to completely randomize a deck of cards and how does it differ for different card shuffling techniques?)
</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When playing card games, mostly you need to shuffle and randomize the cards. But have you ever thought of which shuffling technique is more efficient in randomizing (putting the cards completely out of order) so that you can give a fair game? In this experiment, I will be showing you how many shuffles does it take to randomize a deck and how each technique is different.
