<h1>Ready Set, Shuffle! (how many shuffles does it take to completely randomize a deck of cards and how does it differ for different card shuffling techniques?)
</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When playing card games, mostly you need to shuffle and randomize the cards. But have you ever thought of which shuffling technique is more efficient in randomizing (putting the cards completely out of order) so that you can give a fair game? In this experiment, I will be showing you how many shuffles does it take to randomize a deck and how each technique is different.
</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>Cards were invented in the 1560’s (made by the English). But ever since the 16th century, they stopped manufacturing these cards. But in the 1860’s, the double sided card appeared and in the 19th century, the English pattern was spread around the world. Today, we use these cards to have fun, gamble in casinos, and show off cool magic tricks.  But there was one problem. Since there are casinos and people gamble using cards, the person who shuffles the cards has to be sure that he is giving a fair game to the players. There were new techniques of shuffling. There is the Riffle, Overhand, Hindu, Smooshing, etc. Most cosine dealers use the Riffle shuffle since it's probably the most efficient, but there is a riffle cycle combined with several strips of the second or third cycle known as the Casino Dealer Combination.

<h4>Hypothesis</h4>
<p>After a certain number of shuffles for a particular shuffling technique, the deck of cards will be perfectly shuffled for a fair play. The required number of shuffles to lead to this condition will be vastly different for different kinds of shuffling techniques that we perform, i.e., Riffle shuffle, Hindu shuffle, Overhand shuffle, Smooshing shuffle, etc.

<h8>Procedure</h8>
<p> 1. Order the cards from the Ace to the Kings for each shape.
    2. Do the shuffle you want to do first (Riffle, Overhand, Hindu, Smooshing).
    3. Count the cards that are still in order.
    4. Write them down on a paper or on a Google Spreadsheet
    5. Repeat 2-4 as many times you need to until the number of cards in order reaches 0. 
    6. Repeat 1-5, but choose a different shuffle.
