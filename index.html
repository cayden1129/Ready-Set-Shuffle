<h1>Ready Set, Shuffle! (how many shuffles does it take to completely randomize a deck of cards and how does it differ for different card shuffling techniques?)
</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Research Question: How Many Shuffles Does It Take To Completely Randomize a Deck of
    Cards and How Does It Differ for Different Card Shuffling Techniques?
   
    According to “The Science Explorer”, about 7 Riffle shuffles should completely randomize a
    deck of cards, about 10,000 times for Overhand, about 30 seconds to a minute for
    Smooshing.
    There are 1068 possible arrangements for 52 cards and 4.538 % chance of guessing rightWhen playing card games, mostly you need to shuffle and randomize the cards. But have you ever thought of which shuffling technique is more efficient in randomizing (putting the cards completely out of order) so that you can give a fair game? In this experiment, I will be showing you how many shuffles does it take to randomize a deck and how each technique is different.
</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>Cards were invented in the 1560’s (made by the English). But ever since the 16th century, they stopped manufacturing these cards. But in the 1860’s, the double sided card appeared and in the 19th century, the English pattern was spread around the world. Today, we use these cards to have fun, gamble in casinos, and show off cool magic tricks.  But there was one problem. Since there are casinos and people gamble using cards, the person who shuffles the cards has to be sure that he is giving a fair game to the players. There were new techniques of shuffling. There is the Riffle, Overhand, Hindu, Smooshing, etc. Most cosine dealers use the Riffle shuffle since it's probably the most efficient, but there is a riffle cycle combined with several strips of the second or third cycle known as the Casino Dealer Combination.

<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p> After a certain number of shuffles has been done, the number of cards still in
    order should be 0, giving a fair play. This number will be vastly different for all the shuffle
    techniques like Hindu, Overhand, Smooshing, Riffle, etc
</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<h3>Hindu Shuffle:</h3>
<p> Collect data for the experiment, one shuffling technique at a time.
    For the Hindu shuffle technique, you can do the following:
    <ol><li>Put the cards in order.</li> 
        <li>Shuffle them by using the Hindu technique only 7 times.</li>
        <li>Check and spread out the cards and count the number of cards that
            are in consecutive order.</li>
        <li>Write down the number of ordered cards in the google sheet</li>
       <li> Repeat steps 2-4 and write down the result as long as the number of
        cards in order is 0.</li>
       <li> Plot a smooth line chart for the shuffle serial number (X-axis) vs.
        the number of ordered cards (Y-axis).
        Overhand shuffle has similar steps, only a different way of shuffling the
        cards.</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>(Note: Overhand shuffle has a similar procedure)</strong>
    </p>

<h3>Riffle Shuffle:</h3>
<p>For the Riffle shuffle technique, you can do the following:</p>
    <ol><li>Put all the cards in order starting from the Ace card (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs).</li>
        <li>Shuffle the cards by using the technique only once.</li>
        <li>Once you are done with the round, spread the cards on a flat surface and count the
            number of cards that are still in order.</li>
        <li>Write down the number of ordered cards vs. shuffle number in a table (if you have your
            device on you, try to use Google Sheets).</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 2 - 4 as long as the number of cards in order is 0 and update the results on
            the sheet.</li>
        <li>Plot a smooth line chart for the shuffle serial number (X-axis) vs. the number of ordered
            cards (Y-axis).</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Smooshing Shuffle:</h3>
<p>For the Smooshing shuffle technique, you can do following:</p>
    <ol><li>Put all the cards in order starting from the Ace card (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs).</li>
        <li>Shuffle the cards by Smooshing technique (spreading out all the cards on a flat surface
            facedown and then smooshing) for exactly 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Once you are done with the round, arrange and hold the deck, turn it up and spread the
            cards again on the surface, and count the number of cards that are still in order.</li>
        <li>Write down the number of ordered cards vs. shuffle</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 2 - 4 as long as the number of cards in order is 0 and update the results on
            the sheet.</li>
        <li>Plot a graph for the shuffle serial number (X-axis) vs. the number of ordered cards (Y-axis).</li>
    </ol>
